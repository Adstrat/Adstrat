### Thanks for popping by to check out my Github ðŸ‘‹

I'm a frontend developer based in Berlin, currently working in wordpress PHP and REACT. 

I'm interested in working for meaningful organisations and currently volunteer at [Proveg International](https://proveg.com/), developing webpages about animal welfare and climate change.
