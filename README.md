### Thanks for popping by to check out my Github ðŸ‘‹

I'm a frontend developer based in Berlin, currently working in wordpress PHP and REACT. 

I'm interested in working for meaningful organisations and currently volunteer at [Proveg International](https://proveg.com/), developing webpages which promote plant based diets to improve animal welfare and as a solution to climate change.

Feel free to explore my code.
